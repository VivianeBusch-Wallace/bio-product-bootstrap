What I have learned:
- :root font color changes do not work, instead use * property
- inspect - often need to check where something was applied, for example margins
- adding your own classnames is tedious, coming up with great names is difficult and feels weird
- I should have just copied and pasted from the beginning
- there are no good exercises like freecodecamp to learn bootstrap
- bootstrap 5 has little resources in terms of videos or cheat sheets
- bootstrap was written in SASS
- adding flex to the carousel is a disaster
- because of the javascript specific changes are difficult
- get the right size for pictures... this is so hard
- <hr> is a page divider - will use it in the future
- use square pictures for circles
- read and understand the html first
- hard to find the meaning of each class name in bootstrap
- hard to find the classname in bootstrap that you need
- use bootstrap classnames first to change things before overwriting with your own CSS
- next time will be easier, I am sure!
- finding out what changes with the JS part is very difficult in "inspect".
